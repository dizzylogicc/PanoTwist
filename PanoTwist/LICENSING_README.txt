1. Licenses for the whole project and individual files.

PanoTwist source code is released under the GNU General Public License v.3 (GPL v.3) due to linking to GPL-licensed libraries. However individual source code files in this project written and copyrighted by me (Peter Kondratyuk) are released under the more permissive MIT license. You may use these files separately, if you wish to, in accordance with the MIT license. Linking or compiling these files with GPL-lincenced code would mean that GPL terms must apply to the product of that linking or compilation.

PanoTwist binary files are released under the GNU General Public License v.3 (GPL v.3).
