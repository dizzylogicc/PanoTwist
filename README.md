## PanoTwist
PanoTwist is a free, open source editor for fully spherical (360° x 180°) equirectangular panoramas. It can perform the following editing functions:
* Setting the initial viewpoint
* Rescaling the panorama
* Patching nadir and zenith
  * With an image
  * With averaged color
  * With specified color

Rescaling panoramas is sometimes needed as some web services put a hard limit on maximum size; for example, panoramas uploaded to Facebook must be 6000px x 3000px or smaller.
