## PanoTwist
PanoTwist is a free, open source editor for fully spherical (360° x 180°) equirectangular panoramas. It can perform the following editing functions:
* Setting the initial viewpoint
* Rescaling the panorama
* Patching nadir and zenith
  * With an image
  * With averaged color
  * With specified color

Panoramas can be edited one by one or as a batch.

Rescaling panoramas is sometimes needed as there can be hard limits on the maximum size; for example, in order to upload a panorama file to Facebook, it must be 6000px x 3000px or smaller.

PanoTwist is a non-destructive editor in the sense that it leaves the original images unchanged so that it's always possible to go back. The edited files are saved separately in a subfolder.

64-bit windows installer is available from the [author's website](https://dizzylogic.com/panotwist).
